Audio-only files

Audio-only files of all actors (01-24) are available as two separate zip files (~200 MB each):

    Speech file (Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24.zip, 215 MB) contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440. 
    Song file (Audio_Song_Actors_01-24.zip, 198 MB) contains 1012 files: 44 trials per actor x 23 actors = 1012.

File naming convention

Each of the 7356 RAVDESS files has a unique filename. The filename consists of a 7-part numerical identifier (e.g., 02-01-06-01-02-01-12.mp4). These identifiers define the stimulus characteristics: 

Filename identifiers 

    Modality (01 = full-AV, 02 = video-only, 03 = audio-only).
    Vocal channel (01 = speech, 02 = song).
    Emotion (01 = neutral, 02 = calm, 03 = happy, 04 = sad, 05 = angry, 06 = fearful, 07 = disgust, 08 = surprised).
    Emotional intensity (01 = normal, 02 = strong). NOTE: There is no strong intensity for the 'neutral' emotion.
    Statement (01 = "Kids are talking by the door", 02 = "Dogs are sitting by the door").
    Repetition (01 = 1st repetition, 02 = 2nd repetition).
    Actor (01 to 24. Odd numbered actors are male, even numbered actors are female).
